            <h2>About SRC Sports Academy</h2>
            <p>
                The Pentecost University SRC Sports Academy is a premier sports institution that aims to
                uplift the image of the university and the local community through sports. With support from the
                Student Representative Council (SRC), the academy offers a wide variety of sports, including football, 
                rugby, ballet, table tennis, handball, gymnastics, and the latest additions of wrestling, taekwondo, judo, 
                and volleyball.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission is to foster a culture of excellence, teamwork, and sportsmanship, not just among students but also in the 
                local community. We believe in the power of sports to bring people together, inspire greatness, and create lasting 
                connections.
            </p>
            <h3>Funding & Support</h3>
            <p>
                The academy is funded by both the local community and the national sports body, which allows us to offer 
                high-quality facilities and professional coaching. We have plans to expand our programs further to include 
                more sports and more community engagement activities.
